# Personal repo of practicing coding problems
solved in Python, Go, Haskell

## Practice problem sources 
The problems solved here are taken from these 3 sites : 
- [GeeksforGeeks](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/explore/?problemType=full&page=1)
- [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/algorithms/)
- [haskell99](https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems)

Each directory would consist a README file explaining the problem to solve, and files that solve the problem.

## Motivation
What is the point of this repo?  
Why solve with python, go, and haskell? In 3 languages?? Am I nuts???

> I needed a note / practice environment to practice my problem solving skills. I am fully aware that it is the CONCEPT that is important, not the language itself. However, the 3 languages has its own unique strengths and speciality (but also some downsides) that I wanted to focus on and practice, which are :

TL;DR; training my brain to use pointers and references, object oriented programming, and functional programming.
- I chose Go because...it's the shiny new language ðŸ˜Ž. Jokes aside, I wanted to strengthen my concept of pointers & references. Although I was very compelled to go with c / c++, I wanted to learn a "modern" language. Go was exactly the sweet spot as it used pointers and references, a new language that, at least to me, had a bright future, and was super fast.
- I chose Python because of its easy syntax and its rapid prototyping. Also, I would be able to think in OOP principles easily which is quite critical to have a good understanding in the workfield. 
- I chose Haskell due to its strictly functional programming nature. For some time, I never knew other programming paradigms existed apart from OOP. After knowing that others exist, I couldn't resist my urge to learn functional programming. Also Haskell is cool :)
 
My workflow would generally start by solving the problem with Python first, then Go, then Haskell.
